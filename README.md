## :man_technologist: About Me

Hello, my name is Miraj Sankdecha and I am a dedicated MERN stack developer and freelancer. Currently, I am in my 6th semester pursuing a BCA degree at Atmiya University.

During my academic journey, I have successfully completed several projects utilizing the MERN stack and React.js. Furthermore, I gained invaluable practical experience through a rigorous 6-month internship at Imbuesoft LLP, where I immersed myself in various facets of the MERN stack, including proficiency in tools such as Postman, Git, and GitHub. My experience extends to working with three prominent CSS frameworks, namely Ant Design, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS.

I take pride in my ability to craft and design intricate components, alongside my proficiency in developing APIs. As a result of my experiences and learning, I am now fully prepared and eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a full-time position.
